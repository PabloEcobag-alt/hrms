# HRMS

A staff-facing Human Resource Management system for Bren Raphael's. Its UI shell is copied from CREOMS.

## Language

**Staff**:
A person who signs in through the central Portal and works in HRMS. The Portal calls the same person a User.
_Avoid_: User, admin, Employee

**Portal**:
The central sign-in site that Staff sign in through and are sent into HRMS from. It decides who may open HRMS and which of its Modules. Signing out of HRMS signs the Staff member out of the Portal and every other Bren Raphael's system.
_Avoid_: Auth app, login site

**Module**:
A feature area of HRMS that the Portal grants or revokes per Staff member, shown as one tab in the sidebar. Each HRMS page belongs to exactly one Module. The Modules are Dashboard, Attendance, Employee Information, Payroll & ESS, Recruitment and Hiring, and User Management. The Portal and HRMS use the same Module names.
_Avoid_: Permission, feature, section, page

**Attendance**:
The Module for employee attendance. Biometrics is not a separate Module and is not part of its name.
_Avoid_: Attendance Biometrics, Biometrics

**Widget**:
A summary block on the Dashboard that belongs to exactly one Module and is shown only to Staff who hold that Module. Until its Module has data, a Widget shows the Module name, its purpose, a link into the Module, and "Nothing to show yet". The Dashboard has no Widget of its own.
_Avoid_: Tile, panel, card
