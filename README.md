This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

### Recruitment audit delivery

Run `npm run db:migrate` before deploying recruitment changes. Migration 0003 adds
`hrms_audit_outbox`; each successful Staff mutation commits its Audit Event with
its data change. Set server-only `API_GATEWAY_URL` and `API_GATEWAY_KEY` to the
HRMS Caller (with audit write access for HRMS). Delivery uses `/audit/events`.
The existing authenticated `/api/cron/job-postings` maintenance route retries up
to 50 due events per invocation. Failures are logged without payloads or credentials
and retained with a delay of 1–60 minutes; configure `CRON_SECRET` and monitor logs
and the outbox backlog. Gateway retries reuse the event's idempotency key.

The audit-logs deployment must register `job_posting.created`,
`job_posting.published`, `job_posting.updated`, `job_posting.closed`,
`job_posting.filled`, `job_template.created`, `job_template.updated`, and
`job_template.deleted` for Source HRMS. An older catalog rejects these requests;
they remain queued until that service is updated. Draft deletion, views and
scheduled deadline closure do not emit Staff action events. Applicant notification
delivery is a separate part of parent ticket #28. Publication events explicitly
record `applicants_notified: false` until that integration supplies a delivery result.

### Applicant counts on Job Postings

`jobPostingsFor(...).list()` returns a read-only numeric `applicantCount` on each
Job Posting. It counts rows in the shared Careers `public.applications` table
whose `job_posting_id` matches the posting, excluding only the exact Careers status
`Withdrawn`. All other statuses count, including Received, interview stages,
Hired, Declined, Expired and Rejected. Postings with no Applications or only
withdrawn Applications return zero. Counts are read live, including when filtering
by posting status or title; reading them never writes Applications.

Careers owns the Applications schema. This change needs no database migration;
read access to its existing table is required. Single-posting reads and mutations
continue to return the base Job Posting without the list-only count.
